# Merge all windows

This is a browser extension for Microsoft Edge. 
When you click the button, it merges tabs in all windows into one window.
It essentially provides the same feature as the Merge All Windows feature in Safari.
This is handy if you open many websites in many windows and you want
to consolidate your workspaces.

Then enable 'Developer mode' in the bottom left.
